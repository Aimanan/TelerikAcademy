Fixed no sounds bug
Added sound telling you that maphack was loaded
Added flash window when game start to war3, like msn does 
when you receive new msg...
 Added anti detection to maphack, so even if the patch
to garena failed for some reason, the maphack will still work
and will not be detected and you will be able to use maphack
without garena hack if you want. thanks to dark.one for tips
